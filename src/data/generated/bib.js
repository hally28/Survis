        "abstract": "Predictive maintenance for power electronic converters has emerged as a critical area of research and development. With the rapid advancements in deep learning techniques, new possibilities have emerged for enhancing the performance and reliability of power converters. However, addressing challenges related to data resources, physical consistency, and generalizability has become crucial in achieving optimal strategies. This comprehensive review article presents an insightful overview of the recent advancements in the field of predictive maintenance for power converters. It explores three paradigms: model-based approaches, data-driven techniques, and the emerging concept of physics-informed machine learning (PIML). By leveraging the integration of physical knowledge into machine learning architectures, PIML holds great promise for overcoming the aforementioned concerns. Drawing upon the current state-of-art, this review identifies common trends, practical challenges, and significant research opportunities in the domain of predictive maintenance for power converters. The analysis covers a broad spectrum of approaches used for parameter identification, feature engineering, fault detection, and remaining useful life estimation (RUL). This article not only provides a comprehensive survey of recent methodologies but also highlights future trends, serving as a resource for researchers and practitioners involved in the development of predictive maintenance strategies for power converters.",
